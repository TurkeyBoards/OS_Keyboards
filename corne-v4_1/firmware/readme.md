2. **Connect your keyboard** and make sure it appears in Vial.

3. **Export Settings**:
   - Click the â˜° menu (three bars) in the upper left.
   - Choose **"Backup Settings"**.

     This includes your keymap, lighting, encoder behavior, and other settings.

### Step 2: Enter Bootloader Mode

To flash new firmware, you need to enter bootloader mode:

> NOTE: Unplug your TRRS Cable & follow this process for each half of your keyboard one at a time.

1. **Unplug the keyboard**.
2. **Hold the boot button** on the RP2040 controller (usually labeled `BOOTSEL`).
3. **While holding**, plug the keyboard back in via USB.
4. A new USB drive (e.g. `RPI-RP2`) will appear on your computer.

>  If your keyboard has a reset or boot key combo, you can also use that instead.

### Step 3: Flash the Firmware

### Step 4: Restore Your Vial Settings
