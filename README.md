Precompiled `.uf2` firmware files and source code can be found in the appropriate subfolders:


Each folder typically contains:

- `Layout` â€“ Optional ZMK/QMK/Vial build files and metadata
- `readme.md` â€“ Notes specific to that keyboardâ€™s configuration and usage

## Usage Instructions

Here is a general workflow for flashing your keyboard:

1. **Download the appropriate firmware** for your keyboard from the subfolder.
2. **Flash the firmware** using your preferred tool:
   - For RP2040-based boards: Drag and drop `.uf2` file onto the bootloader drive.
3. **Customize your layout** using:
   - [Vial](https://get.vial.today)
   - `keymap.c` if you prefer to build via QMK manually
